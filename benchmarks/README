This directory contains various benchmarks and examples.  The top-level scripts
are:

make-clean:                      Clean up this directory.
old-benchmark:                   Run the old set of benchmarks, including all
                                 of the Gabriel benchmarks.  The output of this
                                 script is in the file old-results.tex.
fdlcc-benchmark:                 Run the benchmarks from the paper Flow-
                                 Directed Lightweight Closure Conversion.  The
                                 output of this script is in the file
                                 fdlcc-results.tex.
bcl-benchmark:                   Run the fdlcc benchmarks comparing the
                                 baseline, conventional, and lightweight
                                 strategies.  The output of this script is in
                                 the file bcl.tex.
